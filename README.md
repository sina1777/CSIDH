# 📖 Overview  

## 🔐 About CSIDH  
CSIDH (Commutative Supersingular Isogeny Diffie–Hellman) is a post-quantum key exchange protocol designed to secure communications against adversaries equipped with quantum computers. Its security relies on the computational hardness of finding isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves.  

### Key advantages of CSIDH  
- 🔑 **Compact Keys:** Smaller public keys than many lattice-based candidates, suitable for bandwidth-constrained environments.  
- 🔄 **Commutative Group Action:** Enables simple, non-interactive Diffie–Hellman-style key exchange.  
- 🛡️ **Quantum-Resistant Security:** Based on hard mathematical problems believed to resist quantum algorithms.

## ⚡ Why Hardware Acceleration Matters  
Deploying post-quantum cryptography (PQC) on **embedded and resource-constrained devices** (IoT, smart cards, automotive controllers, edge processors) presents unique challenges.  

Software-only CSIDH is often impractical due to:  
- ⚙️ **High Computational Cost:** 512-bit+ modular arithmetic overwhelms microcontrollers.  
- 🔋 **Energy Inefficiency:** Software execution consumes too much power for battery-powered devices.  
- ⏱️ **Side-Channel Risks:** Ensuring constant-time execution in software adds significant overhead.  

### Benefits of Hardware Acceleration  
- 🚀 **Latency Reduction:** Offloads heavy arithmetic for real-time PQC.  
- 🔋 **Energy Efficiency:** Hardware requires a fraction of the power compared to software.  
- 🔒 **Robust Security:** Hardware enforces constant-time execution, mitigating timing/power side-channel attacks.

## 🎯 Targets and Variants  
The accelerator includes **8 top-level implementations**:  

| Target | Security Model      | Parameter Set |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| FPGA   | Standard (Variable-Time) | CSIDH-512  | 
| FPGA   | Standard (Variable-Time) | CSIDH-1024 | 
| FPGA   | Constant-Time       | CSIDH-512     | 
| FPGA   | Constant-Time       | CSIDH-1024    |
| ASIC   | Standard (Variable-Time) | CSIDH-512  |
| ASIC   | Standard (Variable-Time) | CSIDH-1024 |
| ASIC   | Constant-Time       | CSIDH-512     | 
| ASIC   | Constant-Time       | CSIDH-1024    |

🔧 **Shared Arithmetic Core:** All variants rely on a highly optimized two-stage carry-select adder and parallel 512×512 (and 1024×1024) multipliers with partial-product folding.
