# CSIDH
üìñ Overview
üîê About CSIDH

CSIDH (Commutative Supersingular Isogeny Diffie‚ÄìHellman) is a post-quantum key exchange protocol proposed as a candidate for securing communications against adversaries equipped with quantum computers. Unlike classical public-key schemes (RSA, ECC), CSIDH is based on isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves, providing resistance to both classical and quantum attacks.

Key advantages of CSIDH include:

Small public keys compared to lattice-based schemes.

Commutative group action, enabling efficient key exchange.

Potential long-term post-quantum security due to hard mathematical assumptions.

‚ö° Importance of CSIDH Hardware Acceleration in Embedded Systems

As post-quantum cryptography becomes a global requirement, one of the greatest challenges is its deployment on embedded and resource-constrained devices such as IoT nodes, smartcards, automotive controllers, and edge processors. Unlike data centers or high-performance servers, these platforms must meet strict limitations on power, memory, and area.

Running CSIDH purely in software is often impractical in such systems because:

Operations involve 512-bit modular arithmetic, which is computationally heavy for microcontrollers.

Pure software implementations consume high energy and result in long execution times, which is unsuitable for battery-powered devices.

Consistent execution timing is needed to prevent side-channel attacks, but constant-time software is even more resource-demanding.

A dedicated hardware accelerator solves these problems by:

Drastically reducing latency of key exchange, making PQC feasible for real-time embedded communication.

Improving energy efficiency, which is critical for IoT and mobile devices.

Offloading complex arithmetic (additions, multiplications, isogeny evaluations) from the CPU to specialized datapaths.

Offering scalability: FPGA prototypes can be deployed in embedded platforms today, while ASIC designs provide long-term, low-power integration for industrial or consumer products.

By enabling lightweight, constant-time, and high-performance CSIDH operations, hardware acceleration paves the way for practical PQC adoption in embedded systems ‚Äî ensuring that even small, low-cost devices can remain secure in the post-quantum era.

üöÄ Our Implementation:
This work directly targets the embedded systems use case. We present both FPGA and ASIC implementations of CSIDH:

The FPGA design allows rapid prototyping and can be integrated into IoT or edge devices for immediate experimentation.

The ASIC design demonstrates how CSIDH can be built into future low-power chips for secure embedded products.

Our hardware architecture is based on modular building blocks (xMUL, xISOG, xAffinize, xTwist, xDBLADD) optimized for constant-time operation.

By referencing and adapting the original CSIDH C code into a constant-time form for testbenches and comparisons, we ensure that our hardware implementation is both secure and verifiable against software.
